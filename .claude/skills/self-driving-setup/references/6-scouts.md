# Step 6 — Configure the scout troop

**Read ONLY this file.** Do not read any other reference file until this one tells you to.

Scouts are the pull side of Signals: scheduled agents that scan the project on an interval and emit findings as `signals_scout` / `cross_source_issue` signals (which step 4's scout gate lets into the inbox). Every enabled scout is a recurring LLM spend — it costs a full run every tick even when it finds nothing — so the troop is kept **deliberately selective**: the `general` scout, plus the **three to five specialists** for the products this project uses most. Everything else is disabled.

**The whole troop shares one ceiling of about ten enabled scouts** — `general` + 3–5 specialists from this step + 3–5 custom scouts from step 6b, traded against each other so the total stays at or under ten. That ceiling is about quality, not cost: across the fleet, the share of runs that produce a finding holds steady from roughly five to ten enabled scouts and then drops by about half past ten, because a troop that big stops being selective about which surfaces it watches.

Scout runs are also budgeted server-side: a project gets up to **100 scout runs a day by default** during early access (per-team overrides exist, and `scout-metadata-get` reports the enforced numbers). At the default daily cadence one enabled scout ≈ one run a day, so a ten-scout troop uses about a tenth of the budget. **The run budget is a backstop, not the sizing input** — size the troop against the ceiling above, and only consult the budget when it is unusually low (see 1b).

## Status

Emit:

```
[STATUS] Configuring the scout troop
```

## Tools

Reach the scout-config tools through the PostHog `exec` tool — `info` then `call` for `scout-config-sync`, `scout-config-list`, `scout-config-update`, and `scout-metadata-get`.

## Do

1. **Materialize**: call `scout-config-sync`. It is idempotent — it seeds the built-in scout skills for this team and creates any missing configs, then returns the troop.

   **Soft-degrade if the tool is missing or fails**: fall back to `scout-config-list`. If that returns rows, tune those. If it returns nothing, the troop hasn't been materialized yet — record a follow-up ("the scout troop materializes automatically within ~30 minutes; tune it later in PostHog or re-run this setup"), still run step 1b so the report can state the run budget, and continue to step 7. **Not an abort.**

1b. **Read the run budget**: call `scout-metadata-get`. It returns the enforced limits (`max_runs_per_day` — `null` means unbounded — plus `runs_today` and `runs_remaining_today`) and any announcement banner. Record the limits and the banner text for the report. At the default budget the ceiling that binds is the **ten-scout troop**, not the run budget, so size the pick against that and treat this read as a check that nothing unusual is in force. **Only if the budget is genuinely low, shrink the pick to fit**: when `max_runs_per_day` is under ~10 (remember step 6b adds custom scouts at the same cadence), enable fewer specialists so the whole enabled set fits inside it — `general` + one specialist is the usual floor, and only when even that exceeds the budget fall back to `general` alone and note it in the report. **Soft-degrade if the tool is missing or fails** (older PostHog deploy): size against the ten-scout ceiling as usual and continue. **Not an abort.** In the report, say the budget could not be read and quote 100/day as the published default rather than as this project's verified limit — you did not read it, so do not state it as fact.

2. **Decide the enabled set — the whole point of this step is to enable FEW scouts, not many.** Work from the rows `scout-config-sync` actually returned (the troop grows over time — ~19 scouts today — so never hardcode a list). The enabled set has exactly three parts:

   **(a) `general` — always enabled.** `signals-scout-general` watches cross-product correlations and the surfaces no specialist covers; it self-closes cheaply when there's nothing to say. Keep it on for every project.

   **(b) Never enable the `error-tracking` or `session-replay` scouts.** Step 4 already enables error tracking and session replay as native **sources** — their findings reach the inbox through that pipeline, so a scout on the same surface only duplicates it. Disable `signals-scout-error-tracking` and `signals-scout-session-replay` unconditionally, regardless of evidence. This is an **intentional** exclusion, not an evidence gap, so do **not** record a re-enable follow-up for them — note them as "covered by the native source".

   **(c) Up to five specialists — for the products this project uses MOST.** This is a judgment call, not a checklist: weigh ALL the step-2 evidence together — the profile's `top_events` (volume + distinct users), recent activity, the active counts for feature flags / experiments / surveys / dashboards, plus any repo signals — and pick the product surfaces that are most actually used, then enable each one's scout. **Three to five is the normal case on a project with that many genuinely-used surfaces; it is a ceiling, not a quota.** A project that only really uses one or two eligible surfaces gets one or two — never pad the list to reach three (see the rules below, which still bind). The candidate pool is the entire troop **except** `general` and the two excluded in (b); it includes both the surface-specific scouts and the remaining cross-product ones:

   | Scout | Specialist for |
   |---|---|
   | `signals-scout-product-analytics` | funnels / retention / lifecycle insights or heavy product-event usage |
   | `signals-scout-web-analytics` | web traffic / pageviews with referrer or UTM tracking |
   | `signals-scout-feature-flags` | feature flags in active use (frontend or backend) |
   | `signals-scout-surveys` | surveys in use |
   | `signals-scout-revenue-analytics` | a payment SDK / revenue data |
   | `signals-scout-ai-observability` | `$ai_*` events / LLM usage |
   | `signals-scout-logs` | the PostHog logs product in use |
   | `signals-scout-csp-violations` | CSP reporting configured |
   | `signals-scout-experiments` | active A/B experiments |
   | `signals-scout-customer-analytics` | group / accounts analytics (B2B) |
   | `signals-scout-data-pipelines` | CDP destinations, batch exports, or hog flows |
   | `signals-scout-replay-vision` | Replay Vision scanners the team **already** had before this run — the scanners step 6c creates later don't count, since this scout reads trends *across* accumulated observations and there are none yet |
   | `signals-scout-anomaly-detection` | (cross-product) anomalies in whatever time series exist |
   | `signals-scout-observability-gaps` | (cross-product) events with no insight coverage |
   | `signals-scout-health-checks` | (cross-product) PostHog setup health |
   | `signals-scout-inbox-validation` | (cross-product) whether shipped fixes actually held |

   Rules for the pick:
   - **At most five, and only as many as make sense.** Three or four is the norm; add a fifth only when a fifth surface is clearly, actively used. Even if six or more surfaces look used, keep only the five most-used — and remember step 6b needs room under the ten-scout ceiling, so taking all five here leaves it four. Padding the list with surfaces that are barely used is what drops findings per run.
   - **At least one.** Always end with a specialist enabled. If no product surface clearly stands out — e.g. the only products in use are error tracking / session replay (excluded in (b)), or the profile was unavailable and nothing is rankable — **fall back to one universal cross-product scout** (`signals-scout-anomaly-detection` or `signals-scout-health-checks`) as the stand-in. Avoid `signals-scout-inbox-validation` as the fallback on a fresh setup — there are no shipped fixes for it to validate yet.
   - **A scout the table doesn't name** (posthog keeps adding them): treat it as a specialist candidate — read its description, judge whether its surface is among this project's most-used, and enable it only if it earns one of the ≤5 slots.

3. **Disable every scout you did NOT enable** in (a)–(c) — this is now most of the troop. Disable via `scout-config-update` with the config `id` and `{ enabled: false }` — **nothing else**. Don't touch `emit` (dry-run posture) or `run_interval_minutes`; the defaults are correct. A failed update is a follow-up, not an abort.

   For each **surface-specific** scout you disabled, record a re-enable follow-up so the user can switch it on if they do use that surface later (e.g. "enable `signals-scout-logs` in PostHog if you use the logs product"). The error-tracking / session-replay disables are intentional (see (b)) — note them as "covered by the native source", not as a re-enable follow-up.

4. **Show the result.** This step asks the user nothing, so the only in-run visibility is the status line — after tuning, emit one naming the enabled set (short names, no `signals-scout-` prefix):

```
[STATUS] Scout troop: 4 active (general, product-analytics, feature-flags, surveys); 15 disabled
```

(Adjust counts and names to the actual troop and your decisions — the enabled set is always `general` + the 3–5 specialists, so "4 active" through "6 active" is expected; error-tracking and session-replay are deliberately among the disabled.)

Fresh configs have never run, so they're due immediately — the first scans fire on the next coordinator tick, within ~30 minutes, and each run draws from the project's daily budget (step 1b). Record per-scout decisions (enabled / disabled + why) and the budget numbers for the report.
